The focus of this project revolves around binary trees in the C programming language. Binary trees are a type of tree data structure where each node can have a maximum of two children, typically referred to as the left child and the right child. The project comprises several tasks:

    Develop a function for creating a binary tree node.
    Implement a function for inserting a node as the left child of another node.
    Design a function for inserting a node as the right child of another node.
    Create a function for deleting an entire binary tree.
    Develop a function to determine whether a node is a leaf.
    Implement a function to determine if a given node is a root.
    Write a function for traversing a binary tree using pre-order traversal.
    Write another function for traversing a binary tree using in-order traversal.
